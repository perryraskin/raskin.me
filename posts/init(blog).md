I've been meaning to start my own blog for a while now. One thing I really enjoy doing is self-teaching web development topics, and I know I'll learn better if I actually write about it. I believe in this movement of both learning in public and building in public. Just from following different developers on Twitter and/or on podcasts, I've seen that it's really a win-win situation. 

While further strengthening development skills, the provider of the content also increasingly becomes more personable and a better writer. I'm sure I have quite a way to go in that respect. The receiver of this content gets to learn something new, even if the topic is something they've already learned. 

Every individual has a unique way of teaching and delivering material. No matter how many educational resources exist out there on a certain topic, anyone can step in and teach it in their own way. There's always a handful of people who can better identify with a different approach when learning something new.

I hope this blog will allow me to contribute to the online community in the same way that I've benefited from it.

## Some Goals

1. Display relevant data (GitHub projects, Tweets, etc)
2. Publish quick posts about web development, ideally as I learn new things
3. Become super familiar with building with React
4. Learn and implement UI best practices with TailwindCSS
