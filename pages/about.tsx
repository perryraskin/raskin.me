            I've been a techie for as long as I can remember. You know, that guy
            all my friends and family call when they need advice on a new phone
            or computer problem. But for real, I'm a developer, and I pretty
            much always feel that there's too much to learn. Every month I'm on
            a new topic or tech stack. I studied Computer Science at Queens
            College in New York, and that's where I live today.

          office, I'm hacking away on side projects. Often, this is a super fun
          pair programming effort with some good friends of mine.
